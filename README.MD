# Landing Starter Kit



It uses:
- SCSS with linting and autoprefixer
- JavaScript with webpack using babel and linting
- minifying images
- html partials and minify with post-html
- browser-sync

The compiled files will go to the directory "/dist"

- from `src/scss` to `dist/index.css`
- from `src/js` to `dist/bundle.js`
- from `src/views` to `dist/`
- from `src/images` to `dist/images`

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

2. Build resources
```
npm run build
```

3. Watch for changes
```
npm run watch
```
